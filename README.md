========================
My customers will choose items from this menu. My items are Italian pizzas and soft drinks. The program will ask my customers to order, enter the item's number. According to customer's input item number, the program is gonna print out their choice and it's price. And then the program will ask them "how many pizza or drink would you like to buy".Customer will input the number of quantity of items and then the program will ask again "would you like to buy something more, according to yes or no answer; In the end, the program is gonna calculate the total price and it is gonna print out the total price and "enjoy your meal" text.
